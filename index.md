Over the course of 6–7 weeks, you'll learn how to design, implement, and deploy a real-world chatbot using Python and modern web technologies. This site documents your learning journey and will evolve alongside your project.

> 🚧 This page is a living document. More resources and notes will be added as the project progresses!

## 📅 Weekly Plan

This plan is tentative and may be adapted based on learning pace or new ideas.
The weekly plans' hyperlinks are cu

> 🧪 Each week has goals and ends with a "demoable" outcome or checkpoint.

- [**Week 1** – Intro to Python & Git + Environment Setup] 
    - **Goals**: Set up Python, Git, VS Code, and project repo
    - **Outcomes**: Terminal chatbot skeleton with input/output loop

- [**Week 2** – Core Chatbot Logic]
    - **Goals**: Implement hardcoded intents and response logic
    - **Outcomes**: Terminal chatbot can handle ~10 basic queries via dictionary or string matching

- [**Week 3** – External Data & Code Modularization]
    - **Goals**: Move chatbot responses to an external file (e.g., `responses.json`)
    - **Outcomes**: Chatbot can load knowledge dynamically + optional API response integration

- [**Week 4** – Web App Development (Flask)]
    - **Goals**: Convert chatbot into a web app with Flask
    - **Outcomes**: Web chatbot with textbox + submit button, hosted locally

- [**Week 5** – Polish & Deploy]
    - **Goals**: Finalize chatbot UI and deploy to a public platform
    - **Outcomes**: Live chatbot URL via Render/Replit/Heroku + basic styling

- [**Week 6** – Documentation & Final Demo]
    - **Goals**: Clean up repo, document all code, and prepare for presentation
    - **Outcomes**: Well-documented GitHub repo + project demo + team presentation

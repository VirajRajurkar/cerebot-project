## Day 1: Tuesday the 1st of July 2025.


🎉  Welcome! 🎉 

This is your first day as an intern, developing cool software at Cerebriu!! 
For the next few weeks, you will be working on **Cerebot** — a chatbot that we’ll build piece by piece. 

Today is about getting to know each other, learning the roadmap, and setting up the tools you’ll need to start writing code like a real engineer.

### 🎯 Objectives for Today 🎯 

* Feel welcome, excited, and clear about what this internship is all about
* Set up your developer tools: Python, VS Code, GitHub, and Git
* Create your very first chatbot-friendly GitHub project repo
* Leave the day with ideas about how your chatbot might behave

## 💼 Step-by-Step Tool Setup 💼

Follow these steps to set up your development environment :)
Besides their skills, just as a chef relies on good kitchenware, developers rely on a robust coding environment. 

Below, I've tried to list the tools and tutorials on how you can access them. 
Please do not be afraid to look up different YouTube videos than the ones I've attached, blogs, discussion forums, ChatGPT, or people for help. 
The fantastic thing about software development is that it is somewhat collaborative and hands-on. You are your own driver; these resources are meant to get you started!

### ✅ Step 1: Install Python 3.x ✅

We'll write all our code in Python. You can install the latest version here:

* **Download Python:** [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **YouTube Tutorial (Windows):** [How to Install Python 3 on Windows](https://youtu.be/e70ykVBazAg?si=ZkbcjKkPAK_Ld4rL)
* **YouTube Tutorial (Mac):** [How to Install Python 3 on macOS](https://youtu.be/utVZYVJSTZA?si=2NM_ZX3-ccZGWD6K)

🔍 Check if it worked:

* Open the "Terminal" or "Command Prompt"
* Type `python --version` or `python3 --version`

### ✅ Step 2: Install VS Code (Your Code Editor) ✅ 

This is where you’ll write and run Python code.

* **Download Visual Studio Code (aka VSCode) :** [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* **YouTube Tutorial (Windows):** [Install VS Code on Windows](https://youtu.be/DoLYVXR9SSc?si=8SMSH-jV6WpM62dh)
* **YouTube Tutorial (Mac):** [Install VS Code on macOS](https://youtu.be/w0xBQHKjoGo?si=hLc3XCDUBt9_AEIT)

💡 Once you are done with the above installations:

* Open VS Code
* Install the **Python Extension** from the Extensions sidebar

### ✅ Step 3: Create a GitHub Account ✅ 

GitHub will store your code, track your changes, and help us collaborate.

* **Sign up here:** [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
* **YouTube Tutorial:** [How to Set Up a GitHub Account](https://youtu.be/Gn3w1UvTx0A?si=w01aK_GsLQdAMrGT)


### ✅ Step 4: Install Git ✅ 

Just like TikTok enables brainrotted individuals to communicate with others, Git enables your computer to talk to GitHub. 
Please note that Git is not the same thing as GitHub. GitHub is a platform to share code. Git is the medium of communication.
Git is super cool and is almost like its own language. Don't expect to become a master at Git immediately - it's not difficult per se, but it is tricky!

* **Download Git:** [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* **YouTube Tutorial (Windows):** [How to Install Git on Windows](https://youtu.be/t2-l3WvWvqg?si=e6NI0b4t6VFj2DJJ)
* **YouTube Tutorial (Mac):** [How to Install Git on Mac](https://youtu.be/B4qsvQ5IqWk?si=ba9GjesNtPn21ToP)

🔍 Check if it worked:

* Open Terminal / CMD and type: `git --version`

### ✅ Step 5: Set Up GitHub Desktop (Optional but Easy) ✅

If you don’t want to use the command line yet, GitHub Desktop is super friendly.

* **Download GitHub Desktop:** [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
* **YouTube Tutorial:** [Getting Started with GitHub Desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDbjNaFONv4)

### 🚀 Step 6: Create Your First GitHub Repository 🚀

We can do this together, but here’s a preview:
* **YouTube Tutorial:** [Create your first GitHib repository!](https://youtu.be/-RZ03WHqkaY?si=M_jNYqeyVAqrlyVU)

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **“New repository”**
3. Name it `cerebot` (all lower-case)
4. Select “Public” or “Private”
5. (✅ Check “Add README”)
6. Click **Create repository**

### 📘 Homework for Day 1 📘

* Come up with **5 fun or strange questions** you’d like your chatbot to answer (e.g., “What’s the meaning of life?” or “How do I become a wizard?”)
* If VS Code hasn’t been installed yet, we can try it out together!

### 🔁 Tomorrow 🔁

We’ll write your very first chatbot brain in Python using just `print()` and `input()`. Get ready to make your bot talk! 🤖💬

## Day 1: Tuesday the 1st of July 2025.


🎉  Welcome! 🎉 

This is your first day as an intern, developing cool software at Cerebriu!! 
For the next few weeks, you will be working on **Cerebot** — a chatbot that we’ll build piece by piece. 

Today is about getting to know each other, learning the roadmap, and setting up the tools you’ll need to start writing code like a real engineer.

### 🎯 Objectives for Today 🎯 

* Feel welcome, excited, and clear about what this internship is all about
* Set up your developer tools: Python, VS Code, GitHub, and Git
* Create your very first chatbot-friendly GitHub project repo
* Leave the day with ideas about how your chatbot might behave

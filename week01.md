# Welcome to Week 1 !

Welcome to **Week 1 of the Cerebot Project**. This is where we teach your chatbot how to *exist*. That means getting your tools ready, practicing basic Python, and writing your first lines of real code. Think of this week as assembling your botâ€™s brain stemâ€”basic input, output, and memory.

By the end of the week, your bot will:

* Say hello to users
* Ask questions
* Respond differently based on answers
* Be saved safely in your GitHub repo

Youâ€™ll also:

* Set up VS Code, Python, and GitHub
* Understand how `print()`, `input()`, and variables work
* Write your first `if`/`else` logic
* Learn how to commit and push code like a real engineer ðŸš€

# Welcome to Week 1 !

Welcome to **Week 1 of the Cerebot Project**. This is where we teach your chatbot how to *exist*. That means getting your tools ready, practicing basic Python, and writing your first lines of real code. Think of this week as assembling your bot’s brain stem—basic input, output, and memory.

By the end of the week, your bot will:

* Say hello to users
* Ask questions
* Respond differently based on answers
* Be saved safely in your GitHub repo

You’ll also:

* Set up VS Code, Python, and GitHub
* Understand how `print()`, `input()`, and variables work
* Write your first `if`/`else` logic
* Learn how to commit and push code like a real engineer 🚀

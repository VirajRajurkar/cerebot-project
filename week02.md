# Welcome to Week 2 !

Welcome to **Week 2 of the Cerebot Project**. Last week was about getting set up with our tools. As is evident from your task manager, Python is not entirely uncharted territory for you at this point. You should be proud about your use of lists, the input function and loops! This week is all about gaining traction and working towards a Cerebot that has simple conversations in a loop - even if the messages are (somewhat) hardcoded. For instructions this week, I will think of the Cerebot as being an agent that recognises symptoms of stroke and/or mental health. 

Therefore (if we align on this), the Cerebot should be able to at least make a prognosis of what the patient is going through based on certain identified keywords by the end of this week!

As always, I seriously encourage you to shake things up, get creative, and take creative agency if you would rather move in another direction, while keeping me in the loop, of course! ðŸ¤©

By the end of the week, your will:

* Have a simple conversation with the user and make semi-intelligent conversation
* Store and retrieve information from memory
* Rely on clean code in functions based in a GitHub Repository! ðŸš€

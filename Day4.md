### 🚀 Push to GitHub 🚀

As long as you save your work on your own laptop, there is no need to worry about this part. It is optional but SUPER nice to have. 
If you've been successful setting up Git and a GitHub account, let’s save your progress online. 

You should be doing this at least at the end of your day! Please do let me know if you are finding it a bit too challenging with this bit!

**If using GitHub Desktop:**

1. Open your repo folder
2. Click **"Commit to main"**
3. Message: `Add greeting chatbot with if-else`
4. Click **Push origin**

**If using Terminal:**

```bash
git add chatbot_greetings.py
git commit -m "Add greeting chatbot with if-else"
git push origin main
```

And just like that, you’ve backed up your work and can show it to the world. I'll remind you that this is how software engineers document their work!
